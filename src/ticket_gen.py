"""Synthetic support-ticket generator with known-correct labels.

Ground truth has to be known by construction, not guessed at. Each ticket is
assembled from independently chosen phrase banks -- which bank we draw from
*is* the label -- so intent, urgency, frustration level, impact scope, refund
request, and churn risk are all unambiguous, even though the resulting message reads like
a normal email.
